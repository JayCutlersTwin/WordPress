<h5>Places to view</h5>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are multiple spots that whales can frequently be seen. Resident beluga whales cruise offshore right where the city meets the water. These white whales are easily spotted as they surface in silty waters ofÂ Turnagain Arm. About the size of a car, belugas feed on hooligan and salmon runs returning to local rivers and streams. The best spots for beluga include turnouts alongside the Seward Highway, Bird Point and â€“ of course â€“ Beluga Point</p>

<p>There are more than just whales to watch for. There are a mixture of birds and other sea life that can be seen such as puffins, sealions and seals. Anchorage has a fascinating wildlife and is well worth going to visit.</p>
