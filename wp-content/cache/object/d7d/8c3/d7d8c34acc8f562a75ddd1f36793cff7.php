<h2>Anchorage, Portage Pass </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hike the mountains of rural Anchorage Alaska. A very nice easy pass to explore the wildlife of Anchorage Alaska. Well worth a visit. This 2-mile-long (4 roundtrip), family-friendly trail, which begins 90 minutes south of Anchorage at the far end of the Whittier Tunnel, remains the only easy way to see Portage Glacier on foot.</p>

<h4>The beginning</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The adventure begins with the drive from Anchorage to Whittier down Turnagain Arm. Emerge from the tunnel to see Passage Canal and glacier-draped mountains rising along its flanks. Turn sharply left and you can look directly up the length of Lenard Glacier to where it disappears high above around the backside of Maynard Mountain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The hike offers even more marvels, and few difficulties. As you climb steadily up the old road that now forms the trail, you pass glacier-scraped stones and slabs both on and alongside the trail. When you look up, the low brush allows views of the steep, cliff-streaked slope of 4,000-foot-plus Maynard Mountain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All the while you continue hiking steadily toward two stone towers rising against the sky in the pass above. When you climb the last few steps into the narrow gap between those two towers, youâ€™ve reached the pass. A mere 800-or-so feet above sea level. Here, tundra-carpeted mounds beside the trail offer plenty of places to take a break. Between the mounds, youâ€™ll see deep trenches, evidence of the power of ice to shape the landscape</p>

<h4>Make it Challenging</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you feel particularly adventurous, zigzag your way through the tortured landscape to the left of the pass. Look 30 feet down into a gorge as the run-off from nearby snowfields and glaciers rumbles through.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Youâ€™ll skirt one of the sources of that water. A small lake that fills the length of the narrow pass. Then begin the descent to Portage Lake. Along the way, youâ€™ll pass the appropriately named Divide Lake, which flows eastward to Passage Canal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the far end of the lake you then pass over a low rise and begin the 0.75-mile descent to Portage Lake. After winding down through the brush, the trail pops out onto a gravel embankment. From here, a series of small cairns lead you down the slopeâ€™s alluvial plain to the wide gravel beach across the lake from Portage Glacier.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Settle yourself onto the gravel and listen to the water lapping on the shore. Listen even more carefully and you can also hear water spilling from the snow-girted mountains that rise all around the lake. You may even hear the sounds of ice scraping against rock and water dripping through caverns, as Portage Glacier continues its long and slow retreat back into the mountains from which it once came.</p>
