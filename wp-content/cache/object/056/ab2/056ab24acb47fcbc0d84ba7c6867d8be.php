<p>The Alaskan berry cobbler is a true delicacy of the Alaskans. Alaska is certainly well-known for its berries. From familiar blueberries to the more unusual cloudberries and lingonberries, they all make for&nbsp;lip-smacking treats&nbsp;you can pick. If you gather a couple of pints (or have the good fortune to visit a restaurant with a decent berry harvest), a berry cobbler is one of the best ways to savor the fruit. With a cake-like cover and caramelized sugar on top, cobblers remain a perfect conclusion to any meal. Order your cobbler with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and your night is made.</p>
